# Fundamental Statistics Using MATLAB
This project was developed so as to play and tweak with ststical functions using MATLAB. It can be used to teach the fundamentals of numerical statistics or can be modified for specific applications. 

The program generates random integer dataset and exports it as CSV or XLSX file types. It then imports the data from either of the files and computes the measures of central tendency and measures of dispersion. It also plots one column of the dataset matrix against the other for convinient visualization. The project uses MATLAB 2018a in order to edit and compile the program. The built-in Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox was used for this purpose.
